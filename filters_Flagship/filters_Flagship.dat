# It contains the filters to be used when calculating only photmetric models

# If the catalogue contains spec-z you add the following line
# redshift:colName:<redshift column name>
# Example -------> redshift:colName:Z_EAZY

# The possible units that can be used are: Jy, milliJy, microJy, nanoJy
# Alternatively one can pass a conversion factor to convert the fluxes in the
# catalogue into [erg s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1] -----> flux:conversion:<conversion factor>
